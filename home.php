<hr style="border: 2px solid yellow;">

<button class="accordion">What does this server have to offer?</button>
<div class="panelaccordian">
  <p>This is a vintage server filled with Quality of Life updates as well as many new features to improve the game.</p>
</div>	

<button class="accordion">What countries are able to access Dragon Nest Origins?</button>
<div class="panelaccordian">
  <p>Origins is globally active, but is currently supporting Europe, North America West, North America East, South East Asia, and South America.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Does origin host events?</button>
<div class="panelaccordian">
  <p>Yes, we're planning to do enough both PvE and PvP events so the game doesn't feel boring or dead.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Does this server support multiple languages?</button>
<div class="panelaccordian">
  <p>We currently only support English language.</p>
</div>	

<button class="accordion">How hard is leveling up here?</button>
<div class="panelaccordian">
  <p>All dungeons have easy, normal, hard, master and abyss difficulty modes. It is not too grindy, but also not too easy. It also gets easier as your account receives bonuses for maxing out a character. Quests give more experience than they used to (main quests especially), and they also provide you a good enough starting gold to encourage doing them.</p>
</div>	

<button class="accordion">How many classes are available here?</button>
<div class="panelaccordian">
  <p>We now have Warrior, Archer, Cleric, Sorceress, and Kali. About balancing for 50cap specifically, the idea is to keep it as close as it was in official (we only provided Destroyer with a Provoke and increase slightly Physician healing capabilities). This might change in future caps as class discrimination becomes a bigger problem. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Any pay to win aspects ruining the game?</button>
<div class="panelaccordian">
  <p>Absolutely not, costumes or cosmetics here offer no stat advantage and this will <b>never</b> change. Additionally, you can obtain Nest Points for clearing older cap nests and purchase cash items with them.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">How are the staff and developers here?</button>
<div class="panelaccordian">
<p> There will be no empty promises. Things we are capable of doing in a <b>timely</b> manner will happen if we say it. Things that absolutely need to be addressed will be addressed. Our pledge to you is that we are dedicated and will actually produce results that <b>players</b> will actually want to see and even care about. We will allocate our time and resources in order to keep players happy and maintain server success. We will <b>never</b> change.</p>
