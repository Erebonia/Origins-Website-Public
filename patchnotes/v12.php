<h2>Announcements</h2>
<p class="custom-paragraph">Greetings Everyone,
<p class="custom-paragraph">Today's Patch brings a huge infrastructure overhaul on top of preparation work for 50cap release in the coming month. This patch will be divided in two parts. Today, we're replacing our North America server with 2 brand new North America servers placed on the East and the West of the USA. The second part will be focused on a brand new South America server and a replacement for our South East Asia server that had recurring issues. This is a signficant change and we wanted it to be ready before the long-awaited 50cap releases.</p>
<p class="custom-paragraph">Talking about 50cap, this patch also brings some necessary work to prepare for 50cap. 50cap is still on track to release between end of March and early April. Additionally, we brought some changes to our client : Speedrun Boards and security.</p>
