<h2>Announcements</h2>
<p>We have been constantly configuring our network to fight through these DDOS issues and will never give up! We've been working hard at revitalizing and revamping our entire backend infrastructure and thank everyone for being patient and encouraging during these hard times. It definitely feels worth doing everything we do with the support of the community and we couldn't ask for anything more.</p>
<p>Founder packs are now being distributed (no longer for sale) and our new donation system is now up and running.</p>
<p>Ah yes, I almost forgot to mention that we shall be holding an <b>EXP Event from September 28 - October 4th</b> to compensate all of these issues, as well as a <b>Nest Reset on Wednesday</b>. We also plan to increase drop rates for certain items such as dimensional keys and rare grade gear in a coming patch. Please look forward to that and please continue to utilize #suggestions to voice your input and show us what you would like to see in this server. As server masters and developers we want to make it clear that we want to create a more classic official like server with a good economy, but we will always be reasonable with your feedback! Thank you.</p>
