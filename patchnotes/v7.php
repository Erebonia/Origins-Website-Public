<h2>Announcements</h2>
<p class="custom-paragraph">Hello,</p>
<p class="custom-paragraph">Here is our Halloween Patch Part-2! In this patch, we have released Chaos Openings, a revamped Speedrun Board, final chests reward, and some other things.</p>
<p class="custom-paragraph">Additionally, we're launching our Halloween Event. This event will be running for 2 weeks. The idea is simple : collect coins from Dimensional Bunny at the end of dungeons, or simply stay online. With those coins, you can buy items on our Halloween Shop next to Irine. A speedrun event will also be held next week. Keep an eye on #events on Discord.</p>

<h2>Misc Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chaos Openings are here! Head to Garden of Time and Space to enter it and obtain some more suffix materials, or materials to craft your technique accessories!

</li>
<li>Speedrun Board has been completely revamped. A "Rewards" button has also been added to display the current rewards. The new system will have two kind of rewards : Solo and 4-players. Solo rewards are based on a random selection per week of two maps among a selection. For 4-players, it will be the same maps unless we decide to change them. As a result of this final release of the board, all records have been wiped (for the last time).

</li>

<li>Players won't be able to run the client directly anymore. No more "Is server down ?" because of this!</li>
<li>Friend Lists have been reverted to a maximum capacity of 100 friends. Any player above that limit will have his friend list truncated.</li>
