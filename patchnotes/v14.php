</li>
<li>Sea Dragon Nest Unique grade equipments will not give Final Damage on set bonus anymore. We decided to not add Final Damage into existing sets in the future.
</li>
<li>Speedrun Boards are now fully updated with 50cap and finally provide rewards. Three tiers of rewards exist : Tier 1 for new dungeons, Tier 2 for new nests, and a new Tier 3 for current Hardcore raid best time (currently Sea Dragon Nest Hardcore).

</li>
<li>Marriage System is here! After a long tease, you are now able to marry to other players. The process of marrying is not an easy one though : you have to prove to your partner that you will be loyal, starting as his Best Friend. After some experiences together in Dungeons and Nests, you will be able to propose to the other player and finally be married. To earn Best Friend or Marriage EXP, simply clear Dungeons and Nests together.
<br>You will be able to obtain a Best Friend Pledge to register your friend as best friend, and when you have enough best friend experience, use the proposal ring to ask your loved one for marriage! Once you're married, running content with your wife/husband will reward you with marriage experience. For every level you get, you will receive a coin via mail which you can exchange at the marriage shop for many goodies! Levels are unlimited, so have fun playing together!
Head over to Freya NPC in Saint Haven to access the Marriage Coins shop!
</li>
<li>Destroyer kit has been slightly adjusted to be more of a tank. He can now taunt enemies with [Provoke].
</li>
<li>Physician is very lacking in healing power, so we've slightly adjusted its healing ability to make it more viable in parties.
</li>
<li>Ladder has been disabled. This is only for a short duration, as a scheduled Ladder system is in prepration.
</li>
